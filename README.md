## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

From the creation of this project, I learned how to better control custom properties in TailwindCSS and finally worked with an API for the first time.


### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This helped me understand how to set some certain custom properties in Tailwind CSS.
- [Advice Slip JSON API](https://api.adviceslip.com/) - This is the API I used to generate the random Advices.
